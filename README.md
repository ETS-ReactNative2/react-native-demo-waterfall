The waterfall layout is using a 3rd party library and I tested it for good.

The demo loads web images by urls.

I did not use fetch() to get image urls from my Spring server APIs due to my extremely slow upload speed.  :=( (I have to upload my war package to server for nearly 20 minutes...)

While it is easy.
